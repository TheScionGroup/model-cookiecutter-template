    "This notebook should serve as documentation that walks a technical stakeholder through the model development. Avoid overely abstracting code into helper functions. If helper functions are used, they should be highly commented to explain what the code is doing. This notebook is for documenting the analytic integrity of the model, not for demonstrating deployment code objects. \n",

    "When authoring this notebook, please meet the following standards\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model validation is well documented. \n",
    "    - What sample is used for validating model performance. \n",
    "    - What is the proceedure for running model validation? (Cross evaluation, historical simulation, etc)\n",
    "    - What metrics are used for evaluate the model's performance?\n",
    "1. Model form is well documented.\n",
    "    - What is the name of the modeling technique? \n",
    "    - Links are provided to the model's technical documentation and/or literature\n",
    "1. The model's input is displayed. \n",
    "1. When possible, the model's feature importances are clearly documented. A technical stakeholder should be able to determine what predictive variables are driving the model\n",
    "1. If the model is deterministic, each transformations and calculation executed by the model should be organized into individual and sequential code cells, with the output of the execution displayed. \n"
